// Amount of players needed to start Pre-Live countdown, integer. Default=50.
#SeedPlayersThreshold=50

// After reaching the SeedPlayersThreshold, if some players disconnect but the current player count stays at or above this value, donâ€™t stop the
// Pre-Live countdown, integer. Should be greater than zero and less than SeedPlayersThreshold to be considered enabled. default=45. 
#SeedMinimumPlayersToLive=45

// Match length in seconds, integer. Default=21600 (6 hours)
#SeedMatchLengthSeconds=21600

// Target player count for seeding. Bots will be used to fill the server up to this player count.
// Teams will be balanced so that both teams have an equal number of players+bots.
// With SeedTargetPlayerCount=40, this is what you'll see:
// On an empty-ish server			// On a more full server
// Team 1	3 players	17 bots		// Team 1	16 players	4 bots
// Team 2	5 players	15 bots		// Team 2	18 players	2 bots
// Bots will all be killed (and none will spawn) when the seed match is live.
#SeedTargetPlayerCount=40

// All default values listed above will be used if the corresponding setting is not present on config file or commented out.
