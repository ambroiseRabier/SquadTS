/**
 * Warn (then disband) squad leader, when player count is too high in his squad, based on squad name.
 * For example, most MBT (tank) squads are 4 players max, since tanks can only be manned by 4 players max.
 * Usually a MBT squad with more than 4 players means a bad squad lead (likely a new player) and infantry that will not play as a squad.
