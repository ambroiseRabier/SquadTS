### What do you need?

<!--
e.g., A plugin warning the player that on TK, that he needs to excuse himself in all chat.
-->

### Why do you need that?

<!--
e.g., This allows moderation to identify intentional TK.
      This allows Tk-er to know he team killed and give him a chance to excuse himself.
      This allows victims to identify an intentional TK and report him to admins.
      This encourages making efforts to avoid making TK.
-->

### Is there an alternative? If yes, describe it.

<!--
e.g., There is a rule in the server welcome text, but nobody reads it. Moderator can also warn
      players themselves, but this is heavy duty. Having friendlies remind the Tk-er of the rule
      is not as convincing.
      Also, the game does not tell a player if he TK-ed, so if killed friendly might not say anything
      because he is not aware he got Tk-ed.
-->

### Any suggestion on how it can be implemented?

<!--
e.g., No, I am not a technical person.
